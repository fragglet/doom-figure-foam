This is a design for a better foam tray for the Doom Reaper Miniatures boxed
sets that were sold in 2013.

# How to cut

You'll need three sheets of half-inch foam, each 12x10 inch in size. I
bought ["Appalachian Tough" foam](https://www.carolinacustomfoam.com/brands/Appalachian-Tough-%E2%84%A2.html)
in charcoal color, which is designed for gun cases and (apparently) safe to
use in laser cutters.

The [SVG file](combined.svg) contains data for three layers. In Inkscape you
can use Layer-\>Layers... to view the different layers. They are also
color-coded - you can use this with the color mapping feature found on most
laser cutters to only print particular layers.

Before cutting you'll need to change stroke widths to hairline otherwise
the laser cutter won't cut anything. They aren't set to hairline in the file
otherwise Inkscape shows them as invisible.

# Other minutiae

The case used by Reaper Miniatures for the Doom figures set appears to be
manufactured by "Condition 1", their #699 case (it's marketed as a handgun
flight case). You can buy extra cases from Reaper but it's also cheaper to
just buy them directly - search Amazon or eBay for UPC 857357003037.

The arrangement of the figures is inspired by the
[hierarchy of Doom](https://www.doomworld.com/pageofdoom/graphics/treebig.jpg)
magazine ad that was published in the '90s to advertize the PlayStation port
of Doom.
