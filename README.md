Should be polyether foam, charcoal, 1/2in thick. The three layer version has
not at the time of writing been tested out (=laser cut).

The case used by Reaper Miniatures for the Doom figures set appears to be
manufactured by "Condition 1", their #699 case (it's marketed as a handgun
flight case). You can buy extra cases from Reaper but it's also cheaper to
just buy them directly - search Amazon or eBay for UPC 857357003037.
